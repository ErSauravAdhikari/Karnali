# Karnali

Karnali is a demo app I created while learning how to use the Django Ninja Rest API framework.

It's a straightforward app with two models for books and chapters. A book is referenced in each chapter.

I spent around 3â€“4 hours learning this new framework, and here is the sample app I created as a consequence.

Please do not use this code in any production situations, despite the fact that I feel I do not need to mention it. This app will not be updated, and no new features will be added.


## Lessons Learned

- Building REST APIs in Django 
- Django Ninja Rest Framework
- Adding authentication in Django Ninja API [Cookie Based]
- Creating folder based structure for a single app
